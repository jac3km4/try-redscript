# Try REDscript
Source code of https://try-redscript.surge.sh.

This website bundles the redscript [compiler](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript) and [virtual machine](https://github.com/jac3km4/redscript-vm) in a WebAssembly module which makes it possible to run snippets of code directly in the browser (everything happens client-side, there is no backend!).
